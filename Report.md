## Deeper Thinking

The data for this assignment was downloaded from ipapi.co, and the data itself is publicly listed. For the pervious assignment, we used data from Board Game Geek, which a person has a unofficial collection of the BGArena games. It is also worth noting it is actually out of date, since BGGeek has added a category for Digital Implementations of games.

Data of many types are  often available online (Here is a list of a bunch of [free API](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/)s), and even the owners of Board Game Geek have RPGGeek and VideoGameGeek. To try out Board Game geeks API, you can put into the url https://www.boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi2/thing?id=13 and you will get back an XML file with information about the game with id 13. 

Take some time to find other online data APIs that you might be interested in. What kind of data would you like to work with? What kind of data would be useful for you to have access to? Another example of an API a random dog image API https://dog.ceo/dog-api/!

ðŸ”¥ Find at least two other APIs/Data sources (so downloadable data is also valid). Link them, and provide a brief description of what kind of data they provide. These will act as your references for this assignment.

However, just because information is freely available online, it does not mean

* You have legal rights to that information
* The information was collected ethically
* The information is accurate
* The information is without bias
  
ðŸ”¥ Take some time to think about the ethical implications of using data from the internet. What are some ways that you can ensure that the data you are using is accurate and unbiased? Provide some examples of key questions you might ask yourself before using data in a project, and what are some questions you can use to help you evaluate the data you are using. Please include references if you use any, as there are plenty of articles out there talking about this topic.
